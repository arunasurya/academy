## Voting
Any stakeholder can participate in the voting process. 
Your voting weight is determined by the amount of BSQ you use as your stake. 
That amount is locked in and cannot be used until the end of the voting period. 
You need to pay a voting fee to participate in the process.

### Voting Weight
The voting weight is determined by the amount of BSQ you lock in during the voting period. The BSQ amount earned via contributions is given twice as much weight as the amount bought on the exchange. 

### Voting Cycle
The voting cycle consists of four phases: proposal phase, blind vote, vote reveal and vote result. Each voting cycle will last a total of 30 days and a total of 4380 blocks.
