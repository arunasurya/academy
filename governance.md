# Governance

## Introduction

Bisq governance is accomplished in a decentralized way. 

## Voting
Any stakeholder can participate in the voting process and vote on their own proposals. 
Your voting weight is determined by the amount of BSQ you use as your stake. 
That amount is locked in and cannot be used until the end of the voting period. 
You need to pay a voting fee to participate in the process.

### Voting Weight
The voting weight is determined by the amount of BSQ you lock in during the voting period. The BSQ amount earned via contributions is given twice as much weight as the amount bought on the exchange. 

### Voting Cycle
The voting cycle consists of four phases: proposal phase, blind vote, vote reveal and vote result. Each voting cycle will last a total of 30 days and a total of 4380 blocks. 

#### Proposal Phase
During the proposal phase, which lasts 25 days, any stakeholder can make proposals such as compensation requests, asset listing proposals and any other proposals. 

#### Blind Vote 
In the blind vote phase, any stakeholder can vote on any proposal (including their own). As the name suggests, the vote is placed anonymously so that later voters are not affected by the earlier ones.

#### Vote Reveal

#### Vote Result
