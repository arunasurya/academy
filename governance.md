## Voting
Any stakeholder can participate in the voting process. 
Your voting weight is determined by the amount of BSQ you use as your stake. 
That amount is locked in and cannot be used until the end of the voting period. 
You need to pay a voting fee. 

### Voting Cycle
The voting cycle consists of four phases: the proposal phase, the blind vote phase, the vote reveal phase and the vote result phase.
