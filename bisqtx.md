# Bisq Transactions

## Introduction
Bisq transactions are basically bitcoin transactions that have some extra data attached to them. 

## Genesis Transaction
2.5BTC (from a donation) will be used to create 2.5M BSQ in the genesis transaction upon the DAO launch. Since there are 100,000,000 satoshis in 1BTC, 1BSQ is equal to 100 Satoshi. 

## Voting
A stakeholder participating in each phase of the cycle creates a total of three new bitcoin transactions which appear on the Bitcoin blockchain.
