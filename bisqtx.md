# Bisq Transactions

## Introduction
Bisq transactions are basically bitcoin transactions that have some extra data attached to them. 

## Genesis Transaction
2.5BTC (from a donation) will be used to create 2.5M BSQ in the genesis transaction upon the DAO launch. Since there are 100,000,000 satoshis in 1BTC, 1BSQ is equal to 100 Satoshi. 

## Voting
The voting cycle consists of four phases: proposal phase, blind vote, vote reveal and vote result. Each voting cycle will last a total of 30 days and a total of 4380 blocks. A stakeholder participating in each phase of the cycle creates a total of three new bitcoin transactions which appear on the Bitcoin blockchain. Let's take a look at each of these phases and transactions in more detail. You can track these transactions on the Bisq explorer.

### Proposal Phase
In the proposal phase, a stakeholder creates a proposal transaction.

### Blind Vote
Any stakeholder who wants to vote needs to create a blind vote transaction. 

### Vote Reveal

### Vote Result
In the vote result phase, the proposal transaction turns into an issuance transaction if it has been approved by the voters.
