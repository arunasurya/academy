# An overview of the Bisq ecosystem

## Introduction
If you are into cryptocurrencies, you may have heard or even used Bisq, a decentralized exchange that enables you to trade bitcoin for fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Although Bisq is an open-source software, it is continuously maintained by a team of dedicated people called contributors. Together with the app, the traders and contributors make up the Bisq ecosystem. In this post, I will provide a brief overview of the Bisq ecosystem, starting with its core, the Bisq app.

## Bisq App
Unlike other cryptocurrency exchanges, Bisq is fully decentralized. What do I mean by that? I mean that the app is not stored on any central server. If you want to trade bitcoin, all you need to do is [to download the Bisq app](https://bisq.network/downloads/) and now you are part of the Bisq network. The app has internal BTC and BSQ wallets as well as pricing data for bitcoin and other currencies.  

## Bisq Network
The Bisq network consists of nodes running the Bisq software. Just like the Bitcoin network, it is a P2P network that does not have a central server and is instead made up of individual peers. Some of the Bisq nodes may also be full Bitcoin nodes running the Bitcoin Core software. There are public Bitcoin nodes run by the Bisq community that are available to Bisq peers. Upon starting the Bisq app, it connects either to a local Bitcoin full node or several public nodes. In addition to Bisq nodes, the network includes several other nodes, each with a specific function.

### Seed nodes
Every time the Bisq app gets started, it gets connected to seed nodes. Seed nodes run the Bisq software, and they introduce users to other Bisq nodes. 

### Price nodes
Price nodes fetch data from a single centralized website (currently bitcoinaverage.com) and serve it to Bisq nodes.

### Bisq BSQ explorer
[The Bisq BSQ Explorer](https://explorer.bisq.network/index.html) is a Bitcoin full node as well as a Bisq node with a web interface around it. It provides basic info on BSQ transactions.

## Bisq Participants: 
The Bisq app is maintained by a number of people who are called contributors. Anyone can become a contributor, as long as they provide valuable work for Bisq. 
Users: traders
Contributors (including stakeholders)

## Bisq DAO
It allows you to participate in the Bisq DAO in a self-contained way (make proposals, vote, etc).

Discuss the transfer of value from the users to contributors.
