# BSQ Tokens

## Introduction
The BSQ token is a colored coin based on the Bitcoin blockchain. 
It is used in governance such as voting and making proposals as well as in trading in the form of trading fees. 
The main purpose of the BSQ tokens is to transfer value from users of Bisq such as traders to contributors who improve Bisq.
You can find more details on Bisq governance [here](governance.md). 

## Issuance
### Genesis Transaction
2.5BTC (from a donation) will be used to create 2.5M BSQ in the genesis transaction in the DAO launch. Since there are 100,000,000 satoshis in 1BTC, 1BSQ is equal to 100 Satoshi. You can read more about Bisq transactions [here](bisqtx.md).
  
### Decentralized Issuance 
Any contributor can issue new BSQ by submitting a compensation request. If the request is approved in the voting process, the contributor is awarded the amount of BSQ requested.  

## BSQ Supply
The BSQ supply is determined by how much BSQ gets created and destroyed. Issuing new BSQ increases the supply while burning BSQ decreases it. In addition, the BSQ price can affect the supply.

## BSQ Value
Since 1BSQ is equal to 100 satoshis, its value cannot get lower than that. Upon the DAO launch, a trader can purchase BSQ from a contributor to use it as a trading fee. The demand for BSQ will affect its price. 

## Burning
BSQ is burned when used in the form of fees. More precisely, it is used as a miner's fee. Burning BSQ benefits Bisq contributors since the BSQ supply is decreased.

### Voting
BSQ is used by stakeholders in the voting process as the voting stake and voting fee. Your voting weight is determined by how much BSQ you locked in as a stake. Each voter needs to pay a voting fee in BSQ.

### Trading
Traders can incetivized to use BSQ as trading fees because they get a significant discount.
