# BSQ Tokens

## Introduction
At the heart of the Bisq DAO is the BSQ token. The BSQ token is a colored coin based on the Bitcoin blockchain. The main purpose of BSQ tokens is to transfer value from users of Bisq such as traders to contributors who improve Bisq.

The Bisq software contains the script for coloring and uncoloring the tokens. In addition to the BTC wallet, the software also has a BSQ wallet. There are two ways of issuing BSQ tokens: through the genesis transaction and through decentralized issuance.

#### Genesis Transaction
Upon the Bisq DAO, the Bisq developers will create a bitcoin transaction and label it in the Bisq source code as the genesis transaction. The Bisq network will be aware of this label while the Bitcon network will not differentiate it from any other bitcoin transaction. All the subsequent outputs stemming from this transaction will now be colored on the Bisq network. 

You may know that a bitcoin transaction consists of inputs and outputs. A sum of all unspent transaction outputs (utxo) is the amount of bitcoin you own. The genesis transaction will take a utxo of 2.5BTC (from a donation) as its input to create 2.5M BSQ in its outputs to be distributed to past contributors. Since there are 100M satoshis in 1BTC, each BSQ is equal to 100 satoshis. The value of a BSQ token will be primarily determined by market forces but it cannot be any lower than the amount of bitcoin it is based on.

2.5BTC (from a donation) will be used to create 2.5M BSQ in the genesis transaction in the DAO launch. Since there are 100,000,000 satoshis in 1BTC, 1BSQ is equal to 100 Satoshi. You can read more about Bisq transactions [here](bisqtx.md).

#### Decentralized Issuance
Any contributor can issue new BSQ by filing a compensation request at the end of each month for the work done in the prevous month. Let me give you an example: I file a compensation request for 1000BSQ. Since 1BSQ is worth 100 satoshis, I need to create a bitcoin transaction with the input of 100,000 satoshis (plus any transaction fees) from my Bisq BTC wallet. If the compensation request is approved, that transaction is interpreted as an issuance transaction and its output, which was previously in BTC, is now 1000BSQ.


It is important to clarify that as of this moment the Bisq DAO has not been launched yet. Any revenue generated from Bisq trades goes to the arbitrators while the contributors are not being paid yet. They can still submit compensation requests for the work they have done, and the amount of their compensation is tracked on a spreadsheet. They will be paid the earned BSQ amount upon the DAO launch. 

## Uncoloring BSQ Tokens
While new BSQ is created via the genesis transaction and issuance transactions, it can be burned or uncolored in several ways. BSQ is colored when used as fees such as trading and voting fees and burned bonds. The uncolored BSQ turns back into BTC which is used as miners' fees. Uncoloring BSQ benefits Bisq contributors since the BSQ supply is decreased.

### Trading Fees
Upon DAO launch, users can buy BSQ tokens and use them as trading fees which will be heavily discounted compared to trading fees in BTC. Instead of being directly distributed among the contributors, the trading fees will be uncolored which will lead to the decrease in the total BSQ supply. This means that each BSQ will gain in value which is beneficial for all stakeholders.

### Voting
BSQ is used by stakeholders in the voting process as the voting stake and voting fee. Your voting weight is determined by how much BSQ you locked in as a stake. Each voter needs to pay a voting fee in BSQ.

### BSQ Supply
There will be an initial supply of 2.5M BSQ from the genesis transaction. The subsequent supply depends on the amount of compensation requests and the usage of BSQ in the form of trading fees. The compensation requests will increase the BSQ supply while the trading fees will lead to its decrease. 

## BSQ Value
Since 1BSQ is equal to 100 satoshis, its value cannot get lower than that. Upon the DAO launch, a trader can purchase BSQ from a contributor to use it as a trading fee. The demand for BSQ will affect its price.
