# BSQ Tokens

## Introduction
The BSQ token is a colored coin based on the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Issuance
### Genesis Transaction
2.5BTC are used to create 2.5M BSQ in the genesis transaction. This amount is distributed to past contributors.
1BSQ is equal to 100 Satoshi. 
  
### Decentralized Issuance Transaction
Any contributor can issue new BSQ by submitting a compensation request. 
The contributor needs to create a new transaction and seed it with the amount of satoshis equal to the amount of BSQ requested. For instance, if I want to earn 1000BSQ, I need to put in 100,000 satoshis, which will be colored into 1000BSQ upon the approval by the voting process.
