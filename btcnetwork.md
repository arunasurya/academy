# Bitcoin Network

## Introduction
Bitcoin Network is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of nodes running the Bitcoin Core software.
- when you read a document on github.com, your laptop is acting as a client and is connecting to the github.com server.
- each server can serve many clients, and there is a fixed hierarchy between them (a client can't become a server)
- this type of networked system of computers is called a client-server architecture.
- there are other types of network architectures like P2P.
- In a P2P architecture, there are no central servers, only peers.
- a major advantage of P2P is its resilience.
- each node runs a full node program (e.g. Bitcoin Core V0.17.0) which validates all [transactions](bitcointx.md) and blocks.
