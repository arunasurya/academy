# Bitcoin Network

## Introduction
Bitcoin Network is a P2P network of nodes running the Bitcoin Core software.
- a typical network is hierarchical: it consists of a server that provides data and other services, and a client that connects to a server to get that data.
- P2P means that there are no central servers, and all nodes can act both as a server and a client. 
- each node runs a full node program (e.g. Bitcoin Core V0.17.0) which validates all [transactions](bitcointx.md) and blocks.
