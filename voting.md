# Voting

## Introduction
- Any stakeholder (BSQ holder) can vote, including on their own proposals.
- Your voting weight is determined by the amount of BSQ you use as your stake. 
- That amount is locked until the end of the voting period. 
- You need to pay a voting fee to participate.

## Voting Cycle
The voting cycle consists of four phases: proposal phase, blind vote, vote reveal and vote result. Each voting cycle lasts a total of 4380 Bitcoin blocks which amounts to 30 days. 

### Proposal Phase
During the proposal phase, which lasts 25 days, various proposals such as compensation requests, asset listing proposals and others can be made by any stakeholder. 

#### Proposal Transaction
When you make a proposal, you need to create a Bitcoin transaction which is called a 'proposal transaction'.


### Blind Vote 
In the blind vote phase, any stakeholder can vote on any proposal (including their own). As the name suggests, the vote is placed anonymously so that later voters are not affected by the earlier ones.

### Vote Reveal

### Vote Result
