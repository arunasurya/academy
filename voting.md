# Voting

## Introduction
- Any stakeholder (BSQ holder) can vote, including on their own proposals.
- Your voting weight is determined by the amount of BSQ you use as your stake. 
- That amount is locked until the end of the voting period. 
- You need to pay a voting fee to participate.

### Voting Cycle
The voting cycle consists of four phases: proposal phase, blind vote, vote reveal and vote result. Each voting cycle will last a total of 30 days and a total of 4380 blocks. 

#### Proposal Phase
During the proposal phase, which lasts 25 days, any stakeholder can make proposals such as compensation requests, asset listing proposals and any other proposals. 

#### Blind Vote 
In the blind vote phase, any stakeholder can vote on any proposal (including their own). As the name suggests, the vote is placed anonymously so that later voters are not affected by the earlier ones.

#### Vote Reveal

#### Vote Result
