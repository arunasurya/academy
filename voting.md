# Voting

## Introduction
- Any stakeholder (BSQ holder) can vote, including on their own proposals.
- Your voting weight is determined by the amount of BSQ you use as your stake. 
- That amount is locked until the end of the voting period. 
- You need to pay a voting fee to participate.

### Voting Weight
The voting weight is the amount of BSQ you lock for the duration of the voting period. The voting weight is the sum of BSQ used as the voting stake and BSQ earned through contributions. This is done in order to ensure that the voting process is not greatly influenced by a few people who purchased a lot of BSQ and may not be as invested in Bisq as those who earned BSQ.

### Voting Cycle
The voting cycle consists of four phases: proposal phase, blind vote, vote reveal and vote result. Each voting cycle will last a total of 30 days and a total of 4380 blocks. 

#### Proposal Phase
During the proposal phase, which lasts 25 days, any stakeholder can make proposals such as compensation requests, asset listing proposals and any other proposals. 

#### Blind Vote 
In the blind vote phase, any stakeholder can vote on any proposal (including their own). As the name suggests, the vote is placed anonymously so that later voters are not affected by the earlier ones.

#### Vote Reveal

#### Vote Result
