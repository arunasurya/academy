# git basics

- a distributed revision control system
- consists of repos
- a repo contains a set of files and their historical state

- to start working with git, you can either create a new repo or clone an existing one
- to clone with SSH, you need to do the following:
  - create an SSH key pair (public-private)
  - share the public key with the remote (e.g., github)
  - add the private key to your SSH agent for authentication
- repos are remote or local
- local repos are on your computer or server

Basic commands

`git clone` lets you clone a remote repo
