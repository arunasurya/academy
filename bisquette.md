# Bisquette

*This song was written by Aruna Surya in October 2018. It was inspired by Bisq, especially its logo:).*

Verse 1: <br />
If you wanna preserve your privacy<br />
When buying bitcoin<br />
And hold your private keys<br />
Secure in your wallet<br />
I have an option for you to consider<br />
If you love felines, inventions and freedom<br />

Just download this desktop app<br />
And write down your seed phrase<br />
You can choose to do your trade<br />
Online or face to face<br />
Make an offer and you'll hear<br />
Directly from your peer<br />
And in case you have some trouble<br />
An arbitrator will step in<br />
And will help you solve the issue<br />
While your funds are safe<br />
In two out of three multisig<br />

Chorus:<br />
I am a bisquette<br />
And a coquette<br />
I am a bisquette, coquette<br />
Coquette, bisquette<br />
I can tell you<br />
All about Bisq<br />
Either online or<br />
Tete-a-tete<br />

You can be too<br />
Your own bisquette<br />
If you contribute and respect<br />
Values such as<br />
Privacy, meritocracy<br />
And synergy<br />

Bisquette, bisquette, coquette...<br />

Verse 2:<br /> 
Bisq is here to keep the unscrupulous<br />
From taking your bitcoin<br />
And it's here to keep the curious<br />
From being your shadow<br />
If you believe that these things are important<br />
And that Bisq should be censorship-resistant<br />

Just check out this webpage and<br />
Read upon these roles<br />
You may find the ones that fit<br />

Be rewarded for your work<br />
And if you are into Java<br />
We would love for you to join<br />
And together build the network<br />
That will help the world<br />
Trade and cooperate<br />

Chorus:<br />
I am a bisquette<br />
And a coquette<br />
I am a bisquette, coquette<br />
Coquette, bisquette<br />
I can tell you<br />
All about Bisq<br />
Either online or<br />
Tete-a-tete<br />

You can be too<br />
Your own bisquette<br />
If you contribute and respect<br />
Values such as<br />
Privacy, meritocracy<br />
And synergy<br />

Bisquette, bisquette, coquette...<br />
